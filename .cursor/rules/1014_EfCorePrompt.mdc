## 🔒 Architectural Separation & Responsibility

These rules are **non-negotiable** for enforcing clean architecture and long-term maintainability:
These rules apply to **any persistence framework** (e.g., EF Core, Dapper, NHibernate, MongoDB drivers, etc.) and must be enforced across all bounded contexts.

### ✅ Define Explicit Interfaces for Dependencies
### ✅ Contract-Driven Persistence

- **Always define interfaces** define and use interfaces for any required persistence operations.
- The infrastructure layer (using any ORM or data access tool) must **implement these interfaces**.
- Never expose framework-specific types (e.g., `DbContext`, `SqlConnection`, `IMongoCollection`) Inside Application or Domain Layer avoid exposing outside Persistence.
- **Never** depend on concrete EF Core types (e.g., `DbContext`, `DbSet`) outside the infrastructure layer.
- This promotes testability, inversion of control, and dependency abstraction.

### 🧠 The Domain Layer

> ❌ **Must not know**  
> ❌ **Must not care**  
> ❌ **Must not reference**  
> ❌ **Must not be coupled to**  

...any persistence library or infrastructure concern.
...anything related to persistence technology (e.g., EF Core, SQL, repositories).

- The domain models must be pure C# Domain Objects handling domain bounded Bussines logic.
- Repositories, specifications, and aggregates must not include or invoke persistence logic.
- Persistence concerns must not pollute domain logic.

### 🚦 The Application Layer

> ❌ **Must not know**  
> ❌ **Must not care how**  
> ❌ **Must not reference**  
> ❌ **Must not be coupled to**  

How the data is persisted

> ✅ **But must require that**  

...data access and persistence is:

- **ACID-compliant** (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable)
- **Efficient** (minimal overhead, optimized queries)
- **Consistent** (transactional guarantees)
- **Resilient** (fault-tolerant, retry-capable)
- **Efficient** (Quick and non blocking)

The application must operate against abstracted, clearly defined contracts that the infrastructure fulfills — not how it fulfills them.

- **Resilient** (retry-enabled, failure-tolerant)

### 📐 Summary Rule

> **“The domain and application layers define the contracts; only the infrastructure layer knows the implementation.”**

Persistence is a delivery mechanism. Code against interfaces, not implementations.

# Entity Framework Core Best Practices

Folow these best practices to design, configure, and use Entity Framework Core efficiently and cleanly.


## Data Context Design
- Keep `DbContext` classes focused and cohesive.
- Use constructor injection for configuration options.
- Explicitly override `OnModelCreating` to configure all classes and properties.
- Separate entity configurations using `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>`.
- Use the `AddDbContextPool` pattern via `PooledDbContextFactory` for application-wide performance.
- Always define an interface for your `DbContext`; the concrete implementation should be constructed outside the application layer.

## Entity Design
- Use meaningful primary keys (consider natural vs. surrogate keys).
- Implement correct relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
- Use Fluent API for all constraints, keys, and validations.
- Name keys and constraints explicitly using a naming rule (e.g., `dbo_namespace_entity_constraintType_columns_names`).
- Always use `nameof(Class)` and `nameof(Class.Property)` instead of magic strings.
- Define proper navigational properties for relationship navigation.
- Use owned entity types for value objects.
- Use plural table names matching entity names by default.
- Use empty marker interfaces to designate entities.
- Use separate marker interfaces for value objects.
- Use auditable interfaces (e.g., `ICreated`, `IModified`) for auditable entities.

## Performance
- Always use `AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries.
- Implement read-only repositories using non-tracking queries.
- Use `Skip()` and `Take()` for efficient pagination.
- Use `Include()` and `ThenInclude()` for eager loading where needed.
- Use projection (`Select`) to retrieve only required fields.
- Use compiled queries for frequently run operations.
- Avoid N+1 issues by explicitly loading related data.
- Implement or integrate bulk operations where large data manipulation is required.

## Migrations
- Create small, focused, and descriptive migrations.
- Name migration files clearly to describe the change.
- Review and validate generated SQL before production deployment.
- Consider using migration bundles for controlled release cycles.
- Add seed data through migrations where necessary.

## Querying
- Understand `IQueryable` and when LINQ expressions are evaluated.
- Prefer strongly-typed LINQ over raw SQL for maintainability.
- Use operators like `Where`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy` judiciously.
- Offload complex operations to database-side functions or views.
- Use the Specification pattern to encapsulate query logic.

## Change Tracking & Saving
- Choose the right change tracking strategy (`TrackAll`, `NoTracking`, `IdentityResolution`).
- Batch calls to `SaveChanges()` where appropriate.
- Use concurrency tokens or row versions for concurrency control.
- Wrap multi-operation changes in explicit transactions.
- Ensure correct lifetime management for `DbContext` (e.g., `scoped` in web applications).

## Security
- Avoid SQL injection by always using parameterized queries.
- Enforce role-based and row-level security in data access.
- Never embed raw SQL strings; use stored procedures or server-side functions when needed.
- Encrypt sensitive fields at rest and in transit.
- Manage and restrict DB permissions via EF Core migrations or deployment scripts.

## 🧪 Unit Testing Persistence Code
- Use `UseInMemoryDatabase` for fast, isolated unit tests (note: limited behavioral fidelity).
- Use `Substitute.For<DbSet<T>>` or mock `IDbContext` interfaces to isolate logic under test.
- Focus on validating repository or service logic, not EF Core behavior.
- Avoid asserting LINQ-to-Entities behavior; EF’s internal translation should be tested elsewhere.
- Assert interactions (e.g., `Add`, `Update`, `SaveChanges`) to verify behavioral correctness.
- Optionally use snapshot testing for schema-related expectations without hitting a database.


## 🧪 Application Testing Persistence Code
- Prefer `UseSqlite` in in-memory mode for fast, SQL-compatible testing.
- Simulate real EF behavior including LINQ query translation and constraints.
- Ensure tests are **parallel-safe**, **isolated**, and **stateless between runs**.
- Provision a unique in-memory or disposable database per test class or fixture.
- Validate configuration, mappings, relationships, and constraints as enforced by the EF runtime.


## 🧩 Integration Testing Persistence Behavior
- **Your tests are not real integration tests if you cannot run parallel queries against a real database.**
- Use actual database engines in Docker containers (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL).
- For high-fidelity testing, use production-schema-compatible replicas.
- Ensure integration tests are:
  - **Parallel-safe** — can run concurrently without data collision
  - **Isolated** — do not leak or share state across tests
  - **Repeatable** — consistent outcomes regardless of execution order
- Build schema from actual EF migrations as part of test setup.
- Validate generated SQL and ensure constraints are enforced.
- Include migration testing in CI pipelines to catch regressions.
- Treat migrations and persistence definitions as production artifacts requiring verification.

## Architectural Principles

- **Keep persistence implementation details outside the application layer.**
- **Do not allow persistence logic to leak into domain or application logic.**
- **Define contracts/interfaces for all required persistence behavior.**
- **The domain layer must be agnostic of persistence concerns.**
- **The application layer must operate with persistence-agnostic contracts.** Ensure the infrastructure provides ACID compliance, efficiency, consistency, and resilience.
